# bitcoin_mining

ECE 111 Final Project

Implement and optimize a SHA256 hash algorithm such that every file can be compressed into 256 blocks. 

1. Designed and implemented efficient Bitcoin Hashing SHA256 algorithm

2. Implemented pipelining and unfolding computation for SHA256. Improved performance for Bitcoin mining to a theoretical maximum value

3. Languages\&Frameworks used: SystemVerilog, C, Quartus, ModelSim
